# ðŸ§  Named Entity Recogniser

A user-friendly web application for **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** using a pre-trained BERT model. Built with Hugging Face Transformers and Gradio, this tool allows you to extract and visualize named entities (like Person, Organization, Location) from any input text.

## ðŸ§ª Example

Input:

```
Elon Musk is the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, Inc., both based in California.
```

Output:

| Word      | Entity Type | Confidence |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Elon Musk     | PER         | 0.99       |
| SpaceX    | ORG         | 0.97       |
| Tesla     | ORG         | 0.96       |
| California| LOC         | 0.95       |
